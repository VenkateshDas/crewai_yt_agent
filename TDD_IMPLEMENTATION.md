# Test-Driven Development Implementation

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach used in the YouTube Analysis API project. The implementation follows the London School of TDD, focusing on mocking external dependencies.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized as follows:

```
tests/
  ├── unit/                    # Unit tests for isolated components
  │   ├── models/              # Tests for Pydantic models
  │   ├── utils/               # Tests for utility functions
  │   ├── api/                 # Tests for API endpoints with mocked dependencies
  │   └── test_auth_supabase.py # Tests for Supabase authentication
  ├── integration/             # Integration tests for combined components
  ├── mocks/                   # Mock implementations for testing
  ├── conftest.py              # Shared test fixtures and configuration
  └── test_basic.py            # Basic test verification
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following areas:

### 1. Pydantic Models (Unit Tests)

- `VideoAnalysisRequest`: Validates YouTube URLs, analysis types, and other fields
- `AnalysisResponse`: Ensures proper structure and validation of analysis results
- `ContentGenerationRequest`: Validates content generation parameters
- `TranscriptRequest`: Ensures proper validation of transcript retrieval parameters
- `VideoInfo`: Validates video metadata structure

### 2. Utility Functions (Unit Tests)

- YouTube URL validation
- Video ID extraction
- URL normalization

### 3. Authentication (Unit Tests)

- Supabase authentication client
  - User sign up
  - User sign in
  - Token refresh
  - User sign out
  - User information retrieval
  - Token verification

## Implementation Status

The following tests have been implemented and are passing:

- Basic infrastructure test
- Pydantic model validations
- YouTube utility functions
- Supabase authentication client

Still to be implemented:

- API endpoint tests
- Integration tests
- WebAppAdapter integration tests
- Middleware functionality tests

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Install test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r test-requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Running All Tests

```bash
python run_tests.py --all
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Run only unit tests
python run_tests.py --unit

# Run only integration tests
python run_tests.py --integration

# Run with coverage report
python run_tests.py --all --coverage
```

### Running Individual Test Files

```bash
# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_video_models.py -v

# Run multiple test files
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_video_models.py tests/unit/utils/test_utils.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_video_models.py --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Coverage Report

The current test coverage is focused on the core API models and utility functions. As more tests are implemented, coverage will expand to include API endpoints, middleware, and integration scenarios.

## Best Practices

The test suite follows these best practices:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is isolated and does not depend on the state from previous tests.
2. **AAA Pattern**: Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for clarity.
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Test methods are named to clearly describe what they are testing.
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: External services and dependencies are mocked.
5. **Both Success and Error Paths**: Tests verify both successful operations and error conditions.
6. **Manageable Size**: Test files are kept under 500 lines for maintainability.

## Next Steps

1. Implement API endpoint tests for all routes
2. Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
3. Add authentication flow tests
4. Test middleware functionality (CORS, authentication, rate limiting)
5. Implement WebAppAdapter integration tests

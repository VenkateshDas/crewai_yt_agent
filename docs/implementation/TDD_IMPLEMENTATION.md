# Test-Driven Development Implementation

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach used in the YouTube Analysis API project.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized following the London School of TDD, with a focus on mocking external dependencies:

```
tests/
  ├── unit/                    # Unit tests for isolated components
  │   ├── models/              # Tests for Pydantic models
  │   ├── utils/               # Tests for utility functions
  │   └── api/                 # Tests for API endpoints with mocked dependencies
  ├── integration/             # Integration tests for combined components
  ├── mocks/                   # Mock implementations for testing
  └── conftest.py              # Shared test fixtures and configuration
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following key areas:

1. **Pydantic Models**
   - Data validation and transformation
   - Default values and optional fields
   - Error handling for invalid inputs

2. **Utility Functions**
   - YouTube URL validation and parsing
   - Video ID extraction
   - URL normalization

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Authentication flows
   - Video analysis requests
   - Content generation
   - Transcript retrieval

## Running Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
python run_tests.py --all
```

For more specific test runs:

```bash
# Run only unit tests
python run_tests.py --unit

# Run only integration tests
python run_tests.py --integration

# Run tests with coverage report
python run_tests.py --coverage

# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_video_models.py -v
```

## Current Status

The following tests have been implemented and are passing:

- Basic infrastructure test (tests/test_basic.py)
- Pydantic model tests (tests/unit/models/test_video_models.py)
- YouTube utility function tests (tests/unit/utils/test_utils.py)

Total passing tests: 44

## Next Steps

The following test areas are planned for development:

1. Endpoint tests with mocked dependencies
2. Authentication and JWT token tests
3. Integration tests for video analysis workflows
4. Error handling and edge case tests

## Best Practices

The test implementation follows these best practices:

1. **Isolation**: Each test is isolated and does not depend on other tests.
2. **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked to ensure reliable tests.
3. **Naming**: Tests are named descriptively to clearly indicate what they're testing.
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity.
5. **Coverage**: Tests aim for high coverage of critical code paths.
6. **Readability**: Tests are kept simple and readable.

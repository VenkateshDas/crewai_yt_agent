{"video_id": "mJwPvyc4-rk", "transcript": "this was a really special episode I had Ras Mike on and we teach you he teaches you how to get the most out of AI to build your SAS startup and we actually go through a new tool called lovable uh which not many people have talked about but we teach you how to use lovable to go and create a SAS startup in minutes but also one that people will love you're going to enjoy this episode it's an absolute [Music] treat all right special episode Ras Mike is back you asked he's back and what are we talking about today man you know I feel like family at this point so thank you for having me Greg but today I think we want to get a little bit in the weeds and talk about how to get the best out of these AI tools and models because every single day they're getting better but are you getting better on how to use them and that's what we're going to be talking about yeah and I think I think people should stick to the end for this one just because this is this is what people need in order to get the most out of these tools so I'm sure a lot of people have watched some of our episodes even and have been struggling with some of these AI tools but I think what you're going to teach them today is going to just sober them up a little bit and give them what they need to actually get the most out of it so without further Ado Mr Ros Mike thank you Mr Greg I appreciate that so one of the things that um if you've never worked like a big corporate job on the tech side um one of the things you'll realize is how a lot of these companies work and maybe I'll draw I'll scribble my thoughts um often time like let's say there's this big product that the team or the company wants to build and usually the relationship looks like this on one side you have uh product de uh product managers right the people that everyone wants to make fun of on Twitter and then you have the developers right and believe it or not product managers don't just you know film Tik Tok videos doing day in the Liv they they actually are an important part of the organization where they Define certain things right so let's say a feature is going to be built if a feature is going to be built believe it or not in most organizations the developers are not the creatives right we sort of get told what to build now we'll give input uh we give you know like feedback but most of the time it's the product manager that's going to give us the product spec what it needs to look like right the product person will either work with like maybe a ux person so there'll be like a ux team here right there'll be a ux team here and then maybe there's like some business people in suits who are over paid here that are going to tell us what to do right we'll just do business here so but the product person takes information from all these people all the needed assets all the needed information combines it together and distills that information to the developer right so what does you know what what's needed in the feature right um if some of you are product people watching you're familiar with a PRD which is a product uh road map or development road map or PDR whatever the term is called and basically this information is then handed over to the developer the developer will have questions but at the end of the day if the information is good enough the developer can successfully build this and I experienced this on a day-to-day I work with great product people and I realize Greg that a lot of people are um are LED down by the AI tools hallucinating or giving them the wrong thing and that's because most people are terrible product managers if you frame your yourself as you know when you're typing in the AI model that you are a product manager you're you're I hope your mind shifts because giving it one prompt saying oh build this for me and then expecting it to build exactly what's in your mind is what we call daydreaming right so one of the things that I really want to communicate and Greg I would love your feedback is collecting all the information that you need what kind of flows do you need what what uh features are you trying to build what even is the core product you're trying to build right right if you don't have these things figured out and you're just going to prompt your way to success unless you have um the highest subscription for any AI tool you're just going to burn credits right so I really encourage people going back to this part is knowing how to write knowing how to define uh features with extreme precision and studying product and I I say this because I've worked with I work with great product managers now but I've worked with terrible ones and there have been times where requirements have been given to us developers and we've literally built the exact opposite of what they were thinking because they didn't communicate what they were thinking properly so don't assume the model knows the models are dumb they're trained on thousands of lines millions of lines of code so they can sort of predict what you're exactly asking them but they don't know you are the one to know and that's one of the I think best ways to get the best out of your AI uh tools you need to be a product person now and Greg I don't know if I just rambled for a few minutes but hopefully that sort of made sense dude can I just share my screen I know this is Off Script please at my last company I I raised money by this guy named Josh Elman and people who in Silicon Valley know Josh Elman he was like one of the first product managers of LinkedIn Twitter Facebook like you you know he's he's kind of like ask ke beer who's the best product manager he'll be like Josh Elman and he has this really good presentation around what is a product manager do and I'm going to I'm going to fly through this within 90 seconds just so people get a sense of like what a product manager does um well what does a so this is old right what doesn't a product manager do write code right um so that's going to change um but a lot of the a lot of the Frameworks here still make sense so what does a product manager do Define define the market and customer launch timing sales and marketing uh collateral Define the problem and value proposition competitors products and capabilities Define the requirements and road maps that's what you were talking about the PRD product requirement document internal external stakeholder communication this is more important for bigger companies but still matters product evangelist and Champion so and then more simply it's kind of the intersection of where ux Tech and businesses that's what that's what a product manager is um I'm going to keep going through this so uh one of my favorite Parts here where is it in real okay you know basically it's you're the life of a glorified notaker some people think the job of a product manager is glorious in reality the most important thing you do is document decisions follow-up notes usually take longer than actual meetings um so I think that you know I'm just scrolling through this you need to learn people need to learn how to become a great product manager and it's a lot of these Frameworks around like advocating for the user how to communicate how to how to take notes um you're not don't think of yourself I I don't think of yourself as an engineer as a builder I think of yourself as a product manager first and then a builder second quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you out rank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with a 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com so yeah I mean that that's perfect right um I definitely do think great product people will be great users of the models uh just because again i' I've seen a lot of people like write oh create a to-do list a SAS business for me like what does that mean right like how many pages do you need is there an accounts page is there going to be authentication so all these things are very very much necessary and thank you for you know confirming my my thesis on this uh with that slideshow now the second thing I think that's going to help people with getting the best out of AI is just understanding the basics of the web and I I I I don't mean learning how to code and all that stuff although you know I'm a big fan of coding I love writing codes and I think if people gave it a shot they would actually enjoy it but that's not what I'm trying to share essentially what I think is it's very important to understand like what technologies these tools use um right off the bat like I can already tell you um bolt for example bolt. I know there's a lot of people's favorite uses react plus v off the bat right so whenever you start off a new bolt app it uses react for the front end and V is like the compiler the one that builds the app if you use uh v0 which uh recently launch deployments which is pretty awesome uh VZ uses nextjs under the hood right so like what are what's nextjs what's react what are these tools and a lot of people you might hear a lot of people talk about superbase as a database provider right what does super base even mean and I think having a basic understanding of these things can help and that's I'm here to break down so in the web there are three big like sections of the web right like of a proper website SAS whatever you want to call it there's a client side a server side and a data storage side pretty simple stuff the client side is what you see so when I go on uh my portfolio C rosic doxyz what I see this is the client this is the front end right so this is where the user interacts this is your website and then the server is where all the fancy math apis business logic and all that stuff happens and then your database is where all the data stored right so if a user signs up if let's say I have a can band board and I create my to-do list that information needs to be stored and has to be associated with my username so when I log out and then I log back in that same data is there persist persists that's what a database is for so this three block system is what creates a functional SAS I bring that up because having this understanding will help you identify where things are going wrong when you're prompting your models and here's why a lot of people are good at going to a model like for example I can go to vzer and say uh create um landing page for a lawn moing business if I spelled mowing wrong I apologize to my English teacher but so while VZ is prompting what I wanted to show you is right now what I prompted essentially what VZ is going to do is going to work on the front end because I gave it no instructions on what to do on the back I did not tell it we need authentication I did not tell it we need payments I did not tell that we need a database so most people start off with a prompt like this and yes it's writing some fancy looking code but all I'm going to get is an AI generated landing page and that's because I just worked on the front end so it's very important that I understand the difference between what a front end is a backend is and a database is but here's a perfect Here's the the the the crazy part of where we where we are in a society as a tech ecosystem you have companies that are called and Greg I'm sure you're familiar with this companies that are called backend as a service meaning front end is generally considered to be easy though it's not but backend is the is the difficult part you need to worry about security you need to worry about scale I had a startup one time during 2023 a web3 startup um it grew so much that the backend uh the the application we built was not built for scale so it literally broke like it it PE people cannot access it right but we moved over to a backend as a service and guess what they started they handled scale they handled all the users they handled all the fluctuation and a lot of people know these back in as a Services you have a super base you have a slepton one and and Greg maybe bring them on the Pod because they're a great team and their tools amazing a convex these tools basically what they allow you to do is they build out your database so if we go back to my drawing they build out your server and they build out your database and all you kind of have to do is worry about your client and what your client calls um on the server and the database and I know it sounds like I'm saying a bunch of mumbo jumbo but really what a successful AI tool Builder is going to do is they're going to identify okay what am I going to do for my front end so this landing page that I just built on v0 that unfortunately broke let's click fix there uh oh um so people are going to need to identify okay what does my front end look like being a product uh manager but then what backend as a service do I use do I use superbase do I use convex or do I use whatever is out in the market right I think these two are the best ones and I enjoy both and basically what this allows you to do is you now have the ability through these tools to build a full stack application because an application is not just a landing page you need authentication user needs to be able to sign up you need a database data needs to be stored you need payments people need to pay you I hope you want to get paid and having this Frame of Mind understanding that there's a front end that you have to worry about there's a backend in a database you have to worry about there's authentication that you have to worry about is important to know but more than that it's important to pick which tool you want to use for the job and this is why I wanted to talk about uh Greg before I get into it lovable which is a new tool you know a new AI developer tool uh development tool but what's cool about lovable is they have super base integrated so it takes one prompt to get your backend set up it takes one prompt to get your database set up it takes one prompt to take your off set up but I guess before we get into the building stuff did that kind of make sense or did I just Yap technical tget no that it makes complete sense I you know maybe this is two in the weeds but when you're building something how do you think about using super base versus convex like they're both such great plat you know platforms so how do you how do you know what to pick yeah so it it definitely is going to get in the weeds because generally they're both great at what they do now convex wins when it comes to real time stuff right so if you wanted to build a chat application or something where real time like you need some sort of real time notification or you're building some sort of like collaborative tool and you need people to see what other people are doing I think convex wins not that superbase can't do it but convex by default is uh real time so anything you do with convex you get the data real time which is great but there are people and this might be too technical who might need a postgress database right that that's the main database that superbase offers and they're the best at that no one does postgress the way superbase does in terms of DX developer experience especially right so it really depends on the application the user building the best way I would I would say for someone who might not be as technical as your average developer is I would ask an AI model I'd go on chat jpt Claud and be like this is what I'm trying to build and I I know there are these two backend as a Services which one is better for my specific use case there might be one where convex is better and there might be one where super base is better but generally speaking both are great Solutions beautiful all right let's uh let's go into dare I say the uh the the vzero killer the bolt killer the uh the brand new what everyone's talking about lovable yeah and I think we're going to get more of these because YC just keeps funding a lot of these uh tools so that really means one of these is going to explode and I think if someone spends time on the core fundamentals whatever AI tool ends up winning you you'll be a great Builder with it right so let's you know let's start let's build I don't know um I don't want to get too crazy but let's build maybe um any ideas Greg something simple that's not too monstrous um could I mean I don't know how monstrous this is but what about like a not taking tool okay um I want a not taking tool for Founders I want to build a not taking SAS for Founders okay now there should be a user authentication there should be a nice clean landing page explaining why founder need my SAS and will and I'll just end it here and we'll continue from here main thing that I wanted to show is this super base button right here and this is what makes it powerful they have a direct integration with superbase meaning the AI models are well trained on setting up authentication with superbase uh setting up your database tables with superbase which is pretty difficult if the AI models are not very um knowledgeable inset tool but the the way the future is going it seems to me that a lot of these tools are going to be integrating directly with a lot of these backend as a Services right so a lot of the stuff that people are trying to learn right now in my opinion ends up being redundant in the next couple months which is why everybody's asking for a course but I'm not doing it because the tools are just going to get better but one thing that you can teach yourself now that will matter in 6 months a year two years 3 years 5 years whatever is being a great product person being someone who sees a great product and identifies why this is great why the user experience is fantastic being able to write that down and communicate that to a model is where I think the real winners will be not trying to figure out how to integrate superbase with said tool because the tools are going to do it anyway yeah and as an example just I could have said let's build a not taking app that's really cool and the ux is really cool but I specifically said for Founders because like picking the niche being an advocate for the the user is such an important part about of being a great product manager yep yep and I agree 100% And so we have our your founder Journey documented okay I like that so let's click on get started okay it says let's okay I'll just create a random account registration not implemented please connect superbase to enable authentication so I'm going to click here and I've already logged in my superbase account and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to quickly create a new project uh we'll call this YouTube and YouTube Greg and I'm going to create a new project so this is me using superbase and this is how I know they have a direct integration that click took me directly to my account and once I go back if I click here I notice that it says inactive project I have to wait I believe a couple seconds so we'll just let that set up shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses is they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your start startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you by the way I was I was kind of like laughing to myself when I saw it it's just like a button to integrate super base cuz like I had flashbacks to being in CS school and in 200 uh like8 and this stuff was like we had to do the hard work back then yeah yeah no it's it's it's definitely like it's it's it's easy mode like honestly like even as a developer like a lot of developers are like like panicking that oh AI is going to take my job but like even myself like honestly Greg like with these like with the super based or Comics I can literally build anything in warp speed um because like a lot of the hard stuff they take care of right and you know sure they charge like 20 bucks a month but like if you know how to arbit charge that and make more who cares if you pay 20 bucks a month right um that's a that's cocktail in Toronto Lally literally literally it's it's it's a McDonald's meal nowadays unfortunately um but yeah I think there's a lot of like I know I saw a lot of dudes like like doing like full-blown tutorials like how to integrate super base and stuff like manually and it's and it's difficult if you're not a developer right and I knew I was just like somebody's going to figure out an integration and when I saw these guys that's why I was like okay we have to talk about these guys and so your prediction is basically you know Bol or whoever is going to have these Integrations in the next few months yeah so they're going to have templates and Integrations so Integrations with like these backend as a services and then an integration directly with stripe so setting up payments few prompts setting up authentication whatever few prompts I think the mo for the next couple years cuz and I'm willing to argue this is design design and user experience becomes the Moe um because at the end of the day like if you can make the experience much richer much better and you can actually solve the problem um you know that's that's where you win because it's going to be super easy to build if I were like an advisor to convict or superbase that's the top one thing I would work on and if I was an adviser to these AI tools that's the top one thing I'd work on because that's where people are struggling the most and then if you have like a template Market place like like framer and web flow have where like maybe devs put up some templates on like how to use the different tools together it just it we truly enter like the the the birth of like non-technical multi-million dollar founders with no Tech found with no CTO or anything like that yeah I think the way I see it is I think design is is a huge mode distribution also huge mod so the way I think about it is if you think about like the physical world real estate you know the saying location location location like you know if you're opening a store selling you know coffee mugs uh you wanna you want a place where there's a lot of traffic so have traffic go into your store but then you're so that's distribution then when you're in the store the coffee mugs need to wow you off your feet right they need to get you to take out your credit card that's designed that's user experience and then the actual like building of the store well that's essentially getting commoditized right now a lot of these tools yeah and and so I I I agree with you and and that's one of the reasons why like I actually got a pretty like sick uh job offer um as like a lead front end lead um I didn't take it though and I I felt crazy not taking it at first but then I was thinking about like the YouTube channel and like just like the brand I'm building I like if I were to make a a year and a half bet I'm willing to bet that this would be the bigger like play versus that CU we're entering an area where like you said like a time where like distribution matters like the amount of like subpar companies versus like and good companies that hit me up just for ad it blows me away like um and I even told a friend I was like oh yeah I'm I'm charging this for sponsor and apparently I'm completely being undercharge I'm completely undercharged because I I just don't know the game like that right but I've come to realize think you said design and distribution becomes the biggest mod and I think that's where I'm I'm I'm trying to invest my time in because I kind of have the building part down and let's see if this is done okay I think we should be good all right so now if I go over to demos I see YT Greg is green so that means it's good I'm going to click on it and I'm going to click connect so it says I'm not connected to superbase project to GA gather your database structure tables security settings this may take a moment and again this one action is hundreds of prompts uh that people are using on all these different tools that haven't integrated with superbase which is why I think you know all the other tools have seen this they're probably working on this right now I wouldn't be surprised if next week all of them shipped this and this is why again going back to my main point I know I keep repeating it if you focus on the fundamentals you'll end up being a better Builder so it says okay and I can click on my project dashboard my project is set up um it I can read the docs if I want to it's still working so look what it's saying here it says superbase connected follow the instructions in the chat to complete integration so what are the instructions enable sign up login with options like email password or social login so I have to click here I believe oh no that's the uh URL let me go back is it here no that's not it okay what do I have to do let's see Let me refresh this you can now work fully featur here okay I'm going to ask how do I enable this stuff right here sign up login with options because it's asking I have to enable this how do I enable sign up login with options like email password and social login okay so it's creating my database tables it's writing some role level security it's writing policies so like no one can just tamper with my tables again all of this stuff is is not easy to do not trival especially uh and security like that always keeps me up at night like making sure that you're launching something and you you know you don't have to you really don't have to worry that much about security is a in a huge a huge deal and I I definitely do think as like um like these tools start to get popular that like um there's going to definitely be some sort of like intervention government intervention like they kind of have in Europe where you're going to have to adhere to some sort of like security policy and stuff like that so please do take security seriously especially if you're handling user data like you know I know you Founders are about hustle and speed but definitely take a little bit review security maybe hire someone couple bucks to review the security of your application it definitely goes a long way that being said let's try if this set up please connect okay I've already connected you and let me see what's going on it's still working actually uh yeah it's still working so I guess we got to give it a second sorry for all the dead time oh it's okay this is is a live cooking session you know we show we show it all yeah we show it all in these sessions and I think also one thing that people should should know is like this stuff is like without even without like tools aside this stuff is hard like you know as a developer you'll be stuck on like one bug one feature for so long right so you know there's definitely a part of me that says you know you got to have some grit you you know you have to like you're not going to one prompt get anything to work uh the way it should at least so you know definitely it's one of those things where you just got to push through and persevere okay I don't let me I'm going to interfere um let me just check this okay it won't let me write I'm going to just refresh this let it break okay um I believe what I have to do is I have to go to Project dashboard last time I played with this there was a URL so I think I have to go to Authentication let me see providers and then okay email is enabled so that's all I need I'm going to go back to here and say build out sign up and log in with super base and make it work on my SAS why is it interesting uh is there any way I can kill what it's doing right now cuz I think it's stuck all right so you know what we're going to do Greg I'm going to start a new one cuz this one is just stuck part of the game I'm going to start a new tab it happens it happens folks yep it happens we're going to start with and I I actually did this recently I was building uh what was I building yeah I was building uh like my own little meta react framework um and I broke it the first time and I tried to fix it wouldn't work so I was like I just need a clear M I started fresh so let's just same prompt let's start again by the way the landing page goes insanely hard yeah no they uh you know who I can tell you firsthand they uh they trained off uh the Tailwind site uh if I go to opponents and like whereas like because I remember like I know you know what I mean like like if I go here you see that totally you see that this so yeah I saw that I was like I know that design right um I know that design yeah so okay so it's building out these uh seems to be building on my signup page building on my login page and this is our landing page okay spinning up preview okay not as cool as the first one but we'll take it if I click on start on free trial okay I'll just enter my name my email and then the password if I create create it didn't work that's because we did not integrate with super base so I'm going to click connect here so it says I'm now connected to your superbase project gather your database structure table security settings this may take a moment so we'll give that its moment do you think uh you'll be using lovable in 12 months from now you know I like these tools to quick MVP myself um so like let's say like a client hits me up and I have they want me to build something I will kind of instead of me sitting down and thinking about it I'll kind of just try to build it like a smaller version with like a bolt or whatever and then it kind of gives me an idea of like what I have to do and I kind of take that and then start to refine what I have to do so I don't until these Integrations get solidified I I haven't gone like end to end but it's definitely my tester and something that I Ed to build um nvps with so it says you can now work with fully featured backend and add powerful features to make your app functional user accounts login all the good stuff so now I'm going to say now make the sign up and sign in work using super base I'm going to hit enter and now we should see it create my tables and do what it needs to do to make this work it says please review and approve SQL commands now the reason why it's asking me to review this because SQL is no joke um you can really destroy business writing the wrong commands which is why like you know you can copy this maybe take this over to another model and ask you like what are these commands going to do can you review them um but they look good to me so I'm going to click apply okay so now it says the migration is being applied meaning the tables are created now it's going to implement the authentication UI and functionality in the front end I'll update login and sign up components to use super baseed authentication so it's working on that I think we can even click on this look at the code it wres and yeah it looks pretty good to me so we'll let that do it thing clean code commented yeah that's that's honestly if you ask me what's my biggest usage of heyi is comments yeah because comments really help so it says I've implemented the authentication functionality for both login and sign up Pages for for development purposes you should disable email verification in the super based console to speed up the testing process so if I click here I can disable this if I want to but I won't we're actually going to leave that there and we're going to go back here and I'm going to try to sign up and honestly if sign up works then you can pretty much do anything because that's the hardest part let's create an account success please check your email to verify and I'm going to check my email if I got this let me check while you're checking that did I see like you can sign up with Discord and figma like some pretty obscure ones yeah so there's Apple there's Discord there's Facebook well Facebook figma yeah I don't even know what some of these apps are notion twitch slack Spotify but like that's really cool right like how many people are doing login with figma for found or not taking apps like probably not that many yeah yeah and and and and the thing is it's very like they're not easy like like github's integration is pretty simple but the others are not easy right so the fact that they've abstracted that and just made it an enable disable situation is fantastic that being said ladies and gents I just want to show my email look what I got follow this link to confirm your user so like the the email check even worked which is great so what I'm going to do is I'm going to confirm my account and now what I'm going to do is I'm in the signin page I'm going to click sign in and I'm signed in so the authentication actually worked so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to say create the uh not taking page and make it so that only authenticated users can access it so my authentication Works which is fantastic and again you have all these providers like you know phone there's there's a lot that you can do here and if I click on my users here look at what user signed up that's my email right there that's my name right there I sign up through email what time will last sign it so this tool allows you to build a full um a full signin sign up database integration with superbase few prompts now I told it to make the note taking page and it's creating the tables for the notes because I'm signed in but I'm going to write notes and if I'm going to write notes those notes need to be attached to my username and need to be persistent imagine you write your notes and then the second you log out all the notes disappear that's a terrible application right so it's writing it's building out all the tables I'm going to accept um the SQL queries that it wrote and we're going to wait for it to apply as as terrible as the first like go was this honestly would have been I don't know like 60 PRS with any of the other tools yeah it's funny cuz like after using so many now I'm like starting to get numb with how amazing these things this is yeah no it's honestly like it's it's insane like you know there are boot camps that charge like upwards of $20,000 to teach people this um and you and I are doing it through a few prompts and clicks all right so it says the migrations applied um it's created a new route so let's try this I'm going to click Start free trial okay it takes you nowhere so I'm going to say add a nav navigation bar and when I click I'm going to say add a navigation bar and then I'm going to make this like a list and when I click on start free trial nothing happens if I am signed in it should take me to the note taking page if not it should take me to sign in again this is all just being about a great product person so I noticed that I don't have a navigation bar I should probably have a navigation bar and I notice that when I click on start trial nothing really happens and I want it so that when I click this it takes me to the not taking page if I'm signed in but if I'm not signed in I need the user's information so I I need them to sign me in do you even consider yourself an engineer anymore or are you a product manager you know um there so there's a part of me that although these tools are good if we went if someone who's great at using these tools went against myself or even like there's thousands of Engineers better than me I definitely do think the engineer still has the edge in terms of making the more performant and faster application right because like just looking at how it's written the code I'm not saying it's wrong but I can definitely make it much faster already so I still think in cases like that where speed and optimization is important um I will still I still consider myself an engineer but five years from now I I can't even tell you where this thing is going to go because it it honestly is scary uh but so yeah I have my Navar if I click on profile profile page is empty because we haven't done it anything if I click on notes it takes me to notes tab but then if I click on start trial remember what I told it to take me to the notes tab that's what it does and then it says log out here so I just logged out perfect let's say I want to actually open this on the full screen so I can see the URL paths so let me why is the I don't see the let's go back here what I'm going to do is add the navigation bar in the sign in and sign in and sign up page as well um let's do that so I can navigate back home from the sign in page cuz currently there's there's nothing I can click on I mean I can do that but that's kind of a cheat let's go back to log in have you thought of like investing in any of these yeah yeah yeah I uh yeah TBD you should yeah uh so yeah look at that I can go home I click log in if I click Start free trial it's going to tell me create an account I already have an account so I'm going to log in Click sign in and then that nav part pops up so what I'm going to do is when I sign in take route me to the notes note taking page again this is a big deal because not only do we have like our landing page our Navar and all that stuff but we actually have authentication and it's it's done like we don't have to work on authentication anymore right right now I'm working on the flows right someone signs in it should direct take him to the not taking page so it says it's done that I'm going to click Start free trial look at that and then if I log out and I sign back in takes me to my note page now let's say I write Michael and Greg and I'm going say they are best friends which we are which 100% And I click on create note so it says Michael and Greg they are friends so that note is created now here is what's cool about this if I go back to my super base and I click on table editor I'm going to see notes and profiles if I click on profiles this is my profile I have a user ID here um my my name and then what time I created my account if I click on notes I'm going to see my notes stored in the database but here's the thing it's connected to my user ID right so you see user ID here 7bb if I go here the ID is 7bb so this note is attached to my user id meaning if I log out and I sign back in my note is there ladies and gentlemen you have assass now payments are difficult and I hope they have a strip payment integration but you finally have the ability to create this full remember this full flow I showed you your client your server and your database the hardest part was this right here right especially with authentication and database they've made it super easy the final Beast to conquer is payments and what's cool is they also have deployments so I can deploy this publicly right I'm going to click on deploy and we're going to give that a few seconds while that's deploying one of the things you said was authentication is now done what people miss about authentication is let's say you authenticate with uh figma and figma changes their API for whatever reason you have to like maintain it now you don't have to do the maintenance which is a really big deal that's all on super base right and that's kind of what you use them for so it says my site is published if I click on this I have my not taking app if I click on start free trial it's going to tell me to create an account I already have an account so I'm going to sign in we click on sign in my note is there this is cool and why and this is why you should subscribe and like Greg's Channel and I'm going to say hi this is Mike and if I click on create

{"video_id": "HVhXwBYenC8", "transcript": "everyone's talking about Manis AI the Chinese AI app that basically can take your thoughts turn your ideas into fully automated businesses and products now I wanted to try this but I didn't have access so I called my friend Min Choy who came on the podcast and we had a crazy idea can we build a business actually the idea was a docy killer multi-billion Dollar business in some a few prompts and in this episode we go through it and we show you the UPS we show you the downs we show you what's good about Manis we show you what's bad about Manis but if you're here if you care about AI if you care about building businesses understanding how Manis works is a must I was so impressed with some of the stuff it was doing and I was so not impressed with some of the other stuff it was doing uh this video video shows you all about that the good the bad the ugly I recommend you watch the entire episode uh and you make the Judgment call for if you can go and create a business fully automated with a few prompts on Manis AI that generates $1,000 per day enjoy the [Music] episode time baby all right I brought a Min Choy today Min has been going viral recently because he's been playing around with Manis Ai and he's going to give us a first look into how to use Manis to actually build a business that works for you men thanks for taking the time on coming on the show what is the viewer The Listener what are they going to get out of this episode by listening all the way through so thanks for having me Greg uh this is a very uh exciting podcast to join uh it's my first time so thank you um so this manness has been going viral and very crazy in China and it just like came over like just a few days ago and I got an invite um so that I can go play with it and I realized that this thing is just more than the the typical AI that we've been seeing and the thing that is different with this is that we've had a in the past uh that we wanted to make this agent AI where the AI can actually go and like run task and run tools um and as you've seen on like Cloud computer use and browser use and similar to that um and this is sort of like more advanced uh the next stage of that I think that we're getting closer and closer to sort of the glimpse into what the AGI is going to look like so um what I want to show you today is that I I want to take some of you some of your um startup ideas correct and I want to see how far Manis uh AI can take it and we're going to try to do this you know step by step and uh in a very uh like a process oriented way um and we want to see if this thing can really like help entrepreneurs or startup uh owners to really Kickstart their ideas into action um and I think that uh that this will show uh like what this type of Technology can do for us uh in terms of growing a business okay let's uh let's see I mean I'm curious this is my first time getting a glimpse of Manis um I hear I hear big things so yeah let's just let's get right into it yeah let's uh start with some of your great ideas um I think that one of the thing that I uh read recently from your post uh was something about DocuSign I think DocuSign might be a little bit complex but let's give it a shot and see what Manis can do for us okay and while you pull that up my thought on docy sign men was basically that um what's happening is you know docu sign makes I think like billions of dollars or something thousands of employees um for an electronic signature and with AI it's going to just be a lot easier to create software we'll see by the end of this episode to compete with you know the docy signs of the world and instead of charging $10 a seat or whatever they charge you'll be able to make it free or charge just a very small amount so I think that there's an opportunity to build I mean I think multiple people could do this can make about you know at least $1,000 dollar a day in Revenue um and so I'm excited to see if if this could work all right so what do we it says hello men what can I do for you um yeah so this is this is a very uh familiar interface that we see all time uh you know chat jpt kind of had this type of interface and everyone else kind of start copying that um interface design so Manis uh also has a similar you know you got a little chat window with the you speak with the agent uh so you just kind of Simply say what you want um and I I I like to start very uh simple uh uh request uh like you know let's say um create a DocuSign clone quick break in the Pod to tell you a little bit about startup Empire so startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people like me like you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for uh tutorials from um people like me to come in and tell them how do you do email marketing how do you build an audience how do you go viral on Twitter all these different things that's exactly what startup Empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need so you can check out the link to Startup empire.co in the description okay so simple like a super simple request y very simple yeah I start by there um the cool thing about this is that Manis is sort of a multi-agent um under the hood and it's got like planner executor that type of thing and if you remember like very early in the days uh when we used to uh have this uh thing called Baby AGI uh by yoi I don't know if you remember um that kind of used to have that sort of that setup where it had like task Creator and like a executor and Etc so this thing does a similar thing and then what it's going to do is GNA it's going to take your request and then it's going to try to research into what that is and what it needs to do to created it and so even giving a simple request um is doing many things uh like on its own like it's planning it's designing it's executing and it's going to try to run things and then analyze the results and then try to kind of replan or update as needed if it's doing if it's going the right way so you will see a lot of things lot there's a lot going on uh it's doing a lot of planning that I'm researching right now so it's uh doing it you know sort of the Googling right now under the hood and it also checks out their website uh I think it takes Al it also takes screenshots um and it tries to do stuff on it um I did like run into one one interesting thing before was that it it it got stuck on like captas and stuff and I thought that was kind of funny and it wanted me to like kind of intervene and like do something with it so it it has some sort of the uh human in the loop um feature in there as well um so it will ask you for confirmation or you know additional contacts as needed so this is so this is interesting so if I'm understanding this correctly you know before Manis you kind of had to go to a bunch of different places I call it the AI cocktail approach so you would go to maybe a chat GPT um or a grock 3 to kind of come up with the idea and create a PRD and then you'd go to v0 to actually design what it would look like and then you'd go to you know a bolt a lovable a cursor depending where you are and you know in terms of technical prowess actually go and build the idea um and deploy it what what you're saying here is what's happening on the screen um is it's kind of doing all those things at the same time exactly yeah it's it's actually what it's doing is it creates a Sandbox um like a virtual sandbox uh of its own and it it runs like you know command line uh executions uh it runs a browser runs a tools uh which is on the right it's right now is browsing and just capturing stuff uh capturing information I think it's what what it's doing is it's is crawling it um it's it's scraping all the data uh and information it can get uh so since I said doc sign goes to Doc sign and it checks out like what you know type of information and the feature the the product has and then it will probably test it out uh and see like what feature that can capture uh as part of its planning so and remember like we we just started with this very simple to say just go create me a DocuSign clone and it's now just going there and doing its own thing and it's just pretty pretty wild to see that uh where we are with this agentic AI that is able to um kind of uh do most of this task uh on its own understands your request and if it doesn't have all the information it goes and research on its own and I think that's like the key to a lot of this and like you said that we've had many AI tools uh that we had to use like separately and we've done a lot of copy pasting in between um now a lot of that has improved a lot with under cursor lovable uh you know repet and all that U but this is a little bit different because it does more than just coding it actually does the research it actually goes to the browser and it actually catch uh captures the uh information from there directly and and then it takes all that context into his planning uh and then it it formulates a plan of execution and then it goes and executes them so this it's a very interesting way now you what you see on the right side of the markup um the the way it has that markup it this reminds me like a lot from like the baby AGI days baby AGI used to kind of do this in the command line where it shows like it's planning phase and all that stuff and I thought this was interesting so it's doing like step by step on what what it needs to do to create this doc sign clone and that's all I said just go get create me a doc sign clone and it's it's getting all of that information and it's planning replanning and um executing so it's it's very interesting to see and it takes it's going to take a couple of minutes um to get to the end um and also sometimes as task as it's needed uh it may have missed something like in the process of doing this so um yeah there's going to be a lot going on on the on the on the screen now but it's it's going to be pretty interesting what it comes out with so have you ever had an instance where you're like create this app and you're looking at maybe like the markdown like for example if you you know if you go back to the markdown can you go back to the markdown while it's or or it's um yeah I mean you could like look at the twoos oh wow wow that that markdown was just like a it's actually the raw source code but this is the uh preview so cool so so I'm I'm actually going to read a little bit of this we do have a lot of listeners on Spotify and Apple for the uh startup ads podcast um so it says here research DocuSign core features identify key functionality to implement docu uh document user flows and Technical requirements now there could be a case where you're like whoa whoa you know I don't want you to do XYZ I don't want you to identify the key functionalities I just want you to you know maybe only focus on this one feature um is there have you ever asked Manis to do something and then kind of said like oh I made a mistake or you did something wrong is that yeah you can actually uh talk to it in this middle of it progress so um which key function like do you want to limit this to well that's a great question I'm going to pull up the the docy sign website right now um cuz it looks like when I'm on the doc sign website it looks like there's they've created a lot of different products at this point so like for example they have the eature product the payments product they identify all I care about is the E signature product so I just want to confirm that we're only talking about the E signature product so let's only focus on the E signature key functionalities good yes that's cool well that's a really that's actually a really helpful feature cuz like if you're using chat gbt for example it's it's in thinking mode and when it's in thinking mode you're kind of twirling your thumbs unless you stop it and then yeah ask it to do something yeah this is this is probably the one of the coolest feature that I've noticed on this particular product is that I can interrupt it in between without it like you know stopping its work that it's going to try to um as you see here it's going to say I understand you want to focus spefically specifically on the E signature key functionalities and it will adjust the approach to prioritize the course e signature feature of Doc sign so and then it says let me continue in setting up the project structure with this focus in mind so that's this is like one of one of the coolest feature that I've seen on this that you can actually kind of uh as sort of a human in the loop like interrupt the process to uh readjust uh the planning or the setup that's cool I also just noticed that like it's very clean like I I feel I feel like I understand what's going on like I it's very pleasant to the eyes yeah a lot of the a lot of the demos that I've seen uh most people just kind of Kick this off and just kind of walk away and then just uh you know have a coffee or a snack or a lunch and just come back and just check like you know where it's at so it's kind of funny and uh I I know you've seen those videos like with the guy with the person that's on a Tesla driving and you know the person is on his way to some coffee meeting like oh you know create create me some you know talking points for this coffee meeting and it's just kind of driving Zone and the Tesla FSC is driving him and also uh Manis AI is preparing his you know meeting notes it's it's kind of funny we'll we'll include that video so people could see that what's that we we'll show that video on screen so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't I don't like that video that much because uh it it just feel like I don't know what's going on other than I see a car and then screen the screen's kind of small so I don't I don't know if there's doing anything but I thought it was kind of cool just the fact that he was doing it I thought it was cool how long is the you know how long do you anticipate this taking is it like going to be 10 15 minutes 20 minutes um depends um you know if it's something very simple like lot some of the research stuff it actually doesn't take that long um so I I've done a uh research uh to say hey buy me all the research uh on this particular topic and it'll go and just uh do does this Googling and searching and then it'll find it and then just kind of bring the report just like very similar to you know the Deep research and the Deep search Etc so while this is running you know what we can do is uh start a new session and say let's get like top um Gregs startup ideas and see which is the most viable to run on manace while while while it's doing the do on how's that beautiful yeah I think I think for me it's it's it's most viable to run on Manis but also the one with the what does Manis think has the highest probability of success so I'm interested to know I'm interested to see like what is how intelligent is Manis right like there's on this show on the startup ideas podcast I've given away I don't know a thousand plus ideas and the reality is some ideas aren't that good some ideas are good and some ideas are really good yep yep and it's it's really it's really The Listener today it's the the humans the listeners who have to figure out okay this is a really good idea or you know what Greg had too much wine and I don't know what he was thinking when he came when he shared that idea you know you got some really great great ones I I'm surprised that people haven't taken some of those ideas and put it into idea you know put those ideas to work you know all this AI tools they do but a lot of them just DM like they're they're like they keep it to themselves and they just DM me and they're like I built this thing and it's doing like yeah it's crushing I guess if this was you know so easy then everyone will be all like Rich right all right so I asked uh I asked Manis while is doing his DocuSign um creation to research into your startup ideas and the top and top ideas that Manis think has the highest potential that's what it comes up with and see if we can have some actionable uh you know startup ideas that we can also ask you to create while it's doing the docu sign creation okay I have an an edit to this prompt sorry to do this to you men okay but uh I would say I think we should ask for ideas specifically that I've shared on X and ideas that I've shared on the startup ideas podcast and the Greg Eisenberg YouTube channel I think we should just uh qualify that we that's where we want or what do you think should we should we qualify it or should we just let Manis figure it out let's uh let let's have man figure it out all right yeah let's the thing with the thing with this type of ageny AI that I like is that um the it's easier to start with uh that if you notice like on the other AI tools uh people's people are running into issues because they don't know where to start they don't know how to ask and you know they they're not maybe not as good at prompting or have templates and Etc to you know get their ideas across but you click the browser by the way sorry could you click the browser like can it go more full screen okay wow so this is it actually so this is It's on our it's on my holding company's website right now which is by the way in insane I'm surprised checking out your it's checking you out so oh my God it's it's gonna it's going to kind of crawl through your site and just check out what you got and you know grab as much of the information as possible I'm just surprised honestly that it knows how to navigate the website because it's like we created a world so it's kind of like confusing yeah it's uh it's using a uh tool um called uh I believe it's Puppeteer uh which is like an automation tool so it's a it's it automates browser uh tasks it's a uh it's a tool that's been around for a while in test automation World um so and it's using that to uh do a lot of these things it's similar to like what browser use and uh you know Cloud computer use uh uses interesting yeah see all I you know I I just have your name and your just a very broad ask and it just goes into this research mode to kind of find out about you that now it's going to going to your Twitter that's crazy but it doesn't have say Twitter X right it doesn't have an X account though right so it can only see a couple a few of my tweets oh wow so it new to click because in my in my bio it says bio it says click for free startup ideas it knew to click that wow that's crazy yeah it's uh it's it's a different type of agent agentic AI I would say and I know you I know there has been a lot of thing going on uh just like the other day uh that people found out uh that you know Manus AI is really under the hood running like clawed yeah yeah there was a lot of meme going around talking about how yeah this is just a rapper and Etc uh that may be and then may be very oversimplifying it uh I I think uh what they've done is create like a whole framework under the hood I believe is that they got a you know Army of Agents under the hood with many different fine-tuned uh AI models that it's using for specific tasks that and that that's why it's doing what it's doing and I think it's they're they're they've done a really good job in my opinion uh in terms of doing have this you know type of setup of AI that can do all of this task and use all these tools and and you're more you know less of a it's less of a hassle for uh anyone to kind of start using this because you don't know what to ask sometimes and you just kind of have this question and you're you're thinking you throw a simple question that you're not going to get like the information that you want but this goes like Step Beyond that it actually like what look what you saw it will just crawl to your site check out your bio check out your websites and and try to understand you as much as you can and trying to grab all the startup ideas that you have and it says it visited your personal website checked out your social media profiles it's got a little to-do checklist that it goes through and it actually goes and does it so that which is kind of you know remarkable um on where we are with these kind of tools um and I I think this will help um people who are uh non-technical and I think that you know AI tool like Manis AI will help close that Gap um I think a lot of people were just kind of I don't know where to start I'm sure they watched all your um podcasts and all other people's you know YouTube videos um but some people still seem very lost uh as is what I noticed and they're always like asking questions like how what do I where do I start like what can I do you know how how do I ask how do I prompt what template to use it's it's sometimes it's just bit too much for some a lot of the you know non-technical folks I think that this closes that Gap yeah I mean it's non-technical and it's also like this is onerous and a lot of work to go and do all this stuff so if you can have Manis running you know during the day while you're working or even if it works at night too I mean any anytime I guess um it just seems like it could help you even if I mean it's could help you come up with the ideas that you want to do and then put it out in the world allegedly let's see if it actually could do it um by the way I just heard my doorbell ring and I was like my first reaction is like is Manis is Manis at my door is Manis just like coming you know Manis is that you yeah they'll be pretty wild like now robot shows up at your door and you know hey I want to ask you a couple of questions about your startup ideas they'll be pry crazy I feel like this guy's like stuck here collecting Greg Eisenberg startup ideas from his podcast YouTube channel and website maybe it's just like a lot of that's a lot let let what happens uh I feel like stuck but cuz typically when I see using browser I will see like you know navigation in the browser yeah it it was doing that before and now it looks like it's just stopped so could we ask Manis are you stuck yeah let's ask that checking out your videos too maybe Manis is like I don't want to give this this these guys ask them the startup ideas I'm gonna go and like build these myself I don't want to are you stuck are you stuck bro wow there we go okay so it says I'm not stuck you point the finger to YouTube page yeah okay blaming YouTube okay man my dog ate my homework too uh let me continue researching Greg eberg startup ideas from multiple sources and compile list of his most promising Concepts I'll focus on Gathering specific startup ideas okay let's check back on docu sign see where is where see where he's at so he's he's creating the app now so another cool thing about this is that you don't have to have a like a project structure uh as you see on other tools like where you know people say go clone this you know template you know this uh boilerplate uh code and you can use that to build your app and have um cursor and you know wind surve and other tools to to you know build that for you because because their their template is more optimized it's already like skip a lot of steps so you don't have to like ask cursor to do it for you uh and this one you don't have to do anything at all you just kind of say just go ahead and create me this uh app and it'll just create its own project structure and everything now I know it's similar to what you know cursor and Winder does as well um but it's just another uh easy easier step for uh people who wants to get started with this kind of tool how how worried are you that this is going to Chinese servers and how do you think how should people think about that how is it going to turn out no no like I know that Manis is a Chinese company right y so there is some concerns with people around you know having a Chinese like giving data to Chinese companies should people be worried about that how how how how do people think about the fact that this a Chinese company not an American company yeah I mean I think that there is a valid concern that around that I think um the the one of the biggest thing is that if you are a Chinese company um I think you're oblig obligated to give access to the government so because of that reason and I know people are very reluctant to use this and and I think you know again it's a valid concern and I'm I'm a huge you know security uh data safety person privacy so I I don't I don't want people to go and like just start throwing any personal information and give any any kind of stuff on these kind of tools um but at the same time I want them to see where other you know competitions are at you know if we don't know our competitions uh then we we're going to be behind and I think that again this is a lot some people are calling this the second deep seek moment for China and I mean I mean starting to see a lot of that lately uh and I think that we need to get ahead of ourselves in these kind of tools and I we we have the Technologies we just didn't have someone to put the Technologies all together and package it like what Manis has done and I think it's good that they have done it and now that we know you know what can and you know cannot be done and I'm sure there will be many US companies that's now um you know going out there and trying to uh you know build something very similar to this tool which is great and I think that you know need we need options we need you know different Alternatives and I know there are already a several open-source project that popped up uh that builds around what Manis has done so I think that's great and I'm I'm a huge open source uh supporter and I I use open source for almost everything so I think that you know this there's there's nothing wrong with you know using the Tool uh that is located in China just be very careful and mindful of you know what type of data that you give to and and give access access to because some some of these may ask you on certain things and you don't you don't have to give those informations just keep it big um just you know do simple stuff like try it out like go clone this website or something and just kind of see uh how the tool works and what you can get out of it I think that's the important thing the learning um you know I'm a lifelong learner so I'm always trying out new tools and trying on new technologies uh so people should not be scared to try them out but always be mindful of the data that they share cool that's fair yeah I mean all right let's uh let's see where we're at with uh the Greg Eisenberg startup ideas yeah he's still stuck trying to collect the data about you so and this happens um it's it's not like perfect it's in it's still in beta um there are a lot of uh errors still um but it's still cool to see that how it was browsing your websites and all that stuff which is neat and you can go back and you can't go back and see what it was doing and you know all the search that it got it found your website your your X page your YouTube channel your LinkedIn your Instagram it's scraping all your social media profiles and checking you out basically because they want to understand you and want I me because I asked I specifically said your name so it wants to know who you are and all your startup ideas so it's going to go and like just try to find everything okay wow Manis computer has encountered a critical issue you can choose to reset mantis's computer or start a new session so what should we do and this does happen so um when it when something like this happen uh you could either opt to reset computer or start a new session but let's try to reset the computer so it's going to try to reboot this sandbox and try to restart the task the cool thing is they remembers where it left off um now it's not a guarantee that this it will will be able to uh fix whatever the issue that he ran into so we'll see so it's going to reset so let's go back to docy sign and see where it's at still doing his thing it's still building his uh projects um I like it's it's kind of you know very like WorryFree like it's doing all the stuff for you uh it's just I just sit back and just kind of relax would it be annoying to ask Manis like hey Manis what's your ta yeah let's try that see what he say just like every annoying boss yeah but remember the AI is a what is the word um ever uh like not annoyed intelligent assistant right yeah okay so oh it says it's I don't know if you're like it was trying to troll us or something as soon as I asked that he was like i' I've completed it's like I'm done like what's your ETF like oh I'm done like so were we like waiting this whole time and just until I ask I'm like okay all right would you like me to deploy all right so now I ask you a questions like do you want me to uh deploy this to the public network I say yes so and what is that what that's going to do is it's got its own public like similar to what like Bell repet has uh it's got his own little Deployable website and it's going to give you a subdomain with their uh primary domain attached to it um so you can actually see the uh website in action and it doesn't make you sign up to any service when you do this right does that work not yet yeah not I think that when you start asking questions like and I and I haven't gone to gone to that level yet where I wanted to like say hey set up a stripe and stuff and only because like we discussed earlier they would you know force me to give up some of my information so I haven't done that um I I didn't want to go that route yet maybe I'll create like a dummy account and just try out but yeah I mean because the glass half full of that is you ask it to set you up with a stripe account and then all of a sudden they hand it over to the Chinese government or whoever and then all your money is gone yeah yeah for the uh for your audience uh yeah don't do that like I said always when you're on the internet always be careful of what you share uh so that's why I always tell all my family and friends and colleagues so I mean when you're in the when you're in the real world too right if you you know you hire you hire someone or you're getting to know someone and you're just you're giving them the keys to you know would you give them the keys to your apartment like maybe not initially exactly yeah yeah it's compared to the physical world it's so much easier to get those stolen from you in the digital world so got to be even more careful all right so now it's working to deploy and demonstrate the E signature I'm kind of excited yeah I I I I I like I don't know I'm kind of I'm optimistic it's GNA work but I'm kind of like H how would this actually work like this is such a complex like we asked it to do such a complex thing like a multi-billion dollar company in a prompt like come on you know what I mean like can actually exactly exactly yeah all right so Manis has encountered an issue with the deployment process so it's going to try to I guess try to see if you can oh so so he's not going to run it so he doesn't want to uh create in his own production environment that he wants me to run it locally that's fair yeah because I mean I'm not a developer but or I'm a bad developer let's say um actually I'm not a developer I'm not a developer and you know I would do that right like I would want it try it locally first before deploying it right yeah so it's still doing stuff uh oh it's just zipping it up okay I'm GNA ask manace to try again to deploy wow you're getting greedy M you're getting greedy it ran into a terminal error while I was trying to zip I don't know if it was because I I just kind of interrupted says Manis encountered on the right hand side Manis encountered some issues while performing this action no need to worry it will handle the errors on its own yeah yeah that's uh another part of the cool feature is that it's it's able to reflect on itself on the errors that he ran into and he'll try to figure out on its own instead of me copy and pasting or clicking stuff to you know hey there's an error so that's that's that these are the type of seamless operation uh or you know user experience uh for this type of agentic AI and I think that's that's the next level that's that this is where we're getting one more step closer to the AGI where we where we don't have to like know more than what we need to know and just let AI handle uh the stuff that probably knows it better than us anyway on some of the things so well yeah it's abstracted right it's abstracted very abstracted um very you know Black Box um some some may not some may like that and some may not like that um but I think for most users you know they rather have it you know blackbox they they don't want to worry and think about it this audience this is a blackbox audience like the people listening to this are like yeah I don't care how it's done I just want to push my ideas live and I want to push a lot of ideas live yeah just give me the results man you know yeah so yeah so uh I convinced it to uh try to deploy so it it's again trying again see what happens yeah what what what's interesting about your style men is like you're you're a man of few words you just like tell Manis a few words not long prompts and that's your strategy yeah and I and I do both um just you know just to be clear I I I do simple prompts and I also do very very very complex prompts because I want to give like a very specific directions but um for your audience and my audience too uh on on X and I I try to keep it very simple otherwise again most people are just going to get lost on the on on what to do uh and and I want to I want I like to demonstrate to audience that um it's a very simple prompt that I use and I got this results um and and that just kind of always uh makes people like oh wow like that was very easy like yeah like I this is this is the future I want to get into I don't want to have to think so much to um come up with a very elaborate prompt you know when I can just say hey I want this just get it done and and I'm sure along the way you're gonna have a lot of questions and so sort of like an iterative approach to getting to your results so I think you know that's that's sort of the step I'm taking with this and and that's the sort of Step I Take usually um for my audience as well I I don't try to over complicate it um and I think that's sort of the sort of the way these agenty AI is going towards um I think it's trying to take a lot of that load of thinking off you um and trying to understand you know what you want um and maybe in the future maybe they'll just know exactly what you want after a while you know like after working with you for a long time it will probably already know your history of what you wanted and you don't even have to tell them again I think that's of like the AI future that we're going to start to see so you got me thinking of something I think that could be big and I don't I don't think we'll have time to cover it today maybe we will maybe we won't but this Mana seems to me that it's it's it's not just about how can you go and build a product and launch it but it's also probably very useful for growth tactics and actually marketing and growing whatever it is you built so I'd imagine that you probably could do things like SEO I'd imagine that you probably could do things like uh help you know create a Content calendar writing researching based on different styles you know getting basically organic content that sort of thing am I right or wrong on that man yeah yeah I I think absolutely you're you know right on point on that one and I think and I just got me thinking maybe we should you know have man go to one of your site and just see you know how is my SEO on this website great let's uh let's pull up late checkout. agency because I know the SEO on that's probably garbage it's literally a landing you know quick framer landing page if you go to late checkout. agency it's our design agency well I guess you don't even need to go to it we can just ask Manis to go to it right okay yeah this this website okay all right let's ask him let's take this we URL and say critic or I want to here's how I would I would say like I have a feeling that my design agency could be getting a lot more SEO traffic I'm looking for help from you oh I'll wait till you type okay help me improve SEO for my let's start a new session yeah see I'm a long-winded prompted prompt guy I'm a long-winded prompt guy like I I write novels you know what I mean oh really yeah yeah I'm one of those I try to keep it simple yeah I like it okay so you're gonna say help me improve get not not my website it's my design agency this one yeah okay yeah it's yeah okay that's fine let's remove your name maybe yeah exactly let me improve SEO but I want to be clear I do want to be clear that you know basically this this firm LCA lay checkout agency it it works with like the dropboxes and you know the grammar Le and the you know character AIS all these software companies and and and sort of big companies that are looking to be AI first and transition to be AI first and building AI products for them I want to it's not just that I want better SEO like I want the executives from these tech companies to come to the website right so you want those tech tech companies come to this website you see all the companies we work with character AI bolt Salesforce slack and look at all the executives we work with at those companies I want more of those Executives to come to this website via SEO I think it's important when you're doing SEO not just to do it doesn't if I got a million visits to day to this it I don't really care I'd rather a thousand visits but they're highly targeted yeah there we go you said it better than I could so he for the listeners on on Spotify and apple I want a more executive uh of AI first companies to come to this website okay so it says I understand you want to track more Executives to late check out agency website I'll continue my SEO analysis with the specific goal in mind very cool I love how he's like running into like we're we're software testing Manis AI in real time totally again they're going to remind us that uh oh it's in beta yeah yeah our bad we're just testing I I believe a lot of the softwares are all in beta and we're just software testing for them so there's no news there they just they just removed the label beta but there there's a lot you know I I work with many software companies and uh there's a lot of issues uh behind the scene that we just don't talk about so all right oh no it has ran into an issue this guy is not going to deploy oh so it's so this this is a new uh message for me because I I I guess I haven't gone to very long contacts but man's performance May decline with extremely long context um so that's what it's saying so I think it's running to a context limitation so that's one of the thing that I actually wanted to talk about on this episode was that uh there are some limitations uh to manness it's not you know completely magical and just works like everything and it's going to do everything for you and you don't have to worry or anything um the limitation I've ran into obviously is the context the context has uh like especially if there's like a becomes a very complex task uh and it and there's a lot of information that it has to process uh it does run into this issue and I think that this is probably the biggest um issue that manace AI team needs to probably address uh before it goes uh it goes live uh because I think that uh a lot of people are going to run into this similar issues especially power user like me I'm going to you know keep pushing it to its limits and we're going to run into this type show all time and and this is not the first time I've seen the U the error that is is it's gone into other than this context um that it does it does ask you like oh I ran an issue I need to reset the computer I need to do this and that and you know just ask me if I want to uh go ahead and restart or start a new session so basically starting a new session means like it may have run into like some kind of long context issue that it's not able to process so you have to start like whole new session and that's kind of the down then the negative part about this tool is uh is is the contact size so far good to know yep so we were not able to complete his stock design website so that's a bummer um I think that we probably could do a local deploy and try yeah let's try it I mean even the fact that we can do a local deploy is absolute Insanity actually it was trying to zip this thing for me for me to download and it failed earlier so let me check let me check if uh it was able to finish uh creating the uh the Zips I mean it's created all the document structure the code files but it doesn't have the the zip yeah it's so interesting see how different people prompt like I I would be prompting right now I'd probably say I'm just trying to get this to a local to deploy this locally I want to create something that's beautiful that I can show on the podcast um and do you think that you can make that happen like that's how I cuz I talk as if I would be talking to a cooworker yeah I think that you know um it's probably quicker anyway to run it locally to see the results right away because like deployment is is not as a straightforward with these tools um and I know repel has has done that really well um and I think I think that's that's a it's got some good future in you know where the direction they it's trying to go uh their AI agent is is is it's getting better and better um but uh Manis has to work on their deployment process as well so I think I think they're just trying to do too much I think that's part of the problem is they're trying to have all of this kind of package like all this services and products are kind of packaged into this one thing um including deployment and and obviously it kind of shows that deployment is not an easy easy one that they have solved yet um in my opinion I I know there has been like other very simple ones that they they've done uh that that shows uh this like if I do like a game like you know make make a airplane game like Peter fly peter.com right yeah fly. peter.com you're talking about the Peter levels yeah yeah yeah so P Peter level is basically made like a flight simulator using AI 3js oh maximum daily usage limit yeah there's a yeah so there's a limit uh I believe it's 10 so I I actually used a few before this episode so we can't do this one today unfortunately it's you know what's also cool is like it feels like we have like four employees working at the same time what's that it feels it feel what's cool about Manis is it feel it really does feel like you have multiple employees working at the same it's like oh we got this SEO this marketing person we've got this researcher we've got this cracked PMD developer yeah yeah yeah you got one guy working on Doc sign you know you know one agent working on your your startup ideas and one you know working on your uh on the you know improving the SEO for your LCA so it's crazy but um another thing is that the uh the problem that I see is scale uh so obviously you know AIS scale is a challenge for a lot of the companies um and the reason why they're very uh right now they're Invitation Only uh and with an invitation code that you can only have access to Manis um and they're they're limiting those codes too and I and I've been privileged to get like 10 invitation code from them um I actually given that out uh to to users to my um my ex account um I actually asked for 10 more I was GNA I was going to offer it to your audience say hey gre's audience you get 10 codes if you want to try it out but didn't happen so um I think that uh the thing that I noticed is that very early on when people were starting to get access to Manis um their we you know their their web uh has been hammered um and the reason why we're seeing a lot of Errors today actually I was not seeing this this much error uh in the beginning um because there were as many people who had access but now that that uh more access has been given out and more people are on the system uh I start to notice a lot more frequent errors and I think that's part of the um scale issues that they're going to have to address um again for before they go live um and do we know when they're going live I don't know yet uh I have not heard any yeah and I think that they you know they're trying to tease early uh looks like they launched premier uh kind of like what it's been like six days now yeah they they they actually launched it like six days ago but it didn't like get go viral until like two days ago basically so when it came over to us and people in the US start to get access to it and that's when it start to get like real traction and I was one of the early ones who got access and and it it was working pretty good um you know obviously we've done I've done stuff like um pretty basic you know comparisons like doing the Deep research or deep search type of thing making a and as you can see on the left side you know I I I I had more but I deleted them because they they kind of crashed but you know buil a simple SAS website you know clone to apple.com obviously apple.com is one of the you know well-designed websites so um I think it's a it's commonly asked thing like people like goone apple.com uh and then you know do a casual multiplayer game um but the uh the research one works really well obviously um you know you expect that to work well um simple games work well uh landing pages work well um and I think that's sort of the ones that have been very successful uh with Manis AI so far um I think that the other one that it does well um is something like this like you're uh analyzing your websites uh for optimizations um scraping data uh it can actually because is able to control the browser and go to go to the website and actually crawl through it like clicking stuff like you can actually like scrape uh data uh using it so I think that's one of the uh very easy easy to use and you know probably frequently used uh tool to kind of get information for uh for the people and the as you get more complex uh like DocuSign and stuff like it does it does have its challenges but I I like to you know push things to its limits so uh just to wrap up maybe let's just go through what we've done today let's go through the docy sign let's go through the startup ideas and let's see let's see what we were able to do in you know 60 minutes and using Manis yep so we started with this create docu sign clone um and middle of it we say hold on let's just focus on the E signature so we we say okay just focus on that and it replanned his um project and it set up all the code and I didn't actually get to see the code yet U but it looked like it set up it's typical nextjs uh app set up its routes um and and then it was create a interface with login page register page the routes the passwords the middleware routes um so it came it looked like it went through a lot of the um important things that it need the basic ones at least um and once it got through creating this uh code uh it got stuck on getting the deployment uh successful so we got document upload document management and the signature field placement so I'm actually excited to see if it actually runs U but it wasn't able to deploy so I what I would do is um I would I would actually like run this locally and then I can like send it over to you see what that looks like um again uh one thing that I I do uh when it asked me to run it locally is uh I do have to scan through the code just just in case totally yeah so I don't just download this that's why I didn't want to do it on the uh on this recording um because that's fair I didn't want to look like paranoid keeping it real here huh trying to play safe you know I don't know what's gonna happen and I do like to create this into like a my own sandbox I don't I don't download this stuff into my local computer I have a I just create like a virtual sandbox on in the cloud and then I I run it there just in case as well so I don't want to do that on this uh session um but I I will do that and then I'll show how that ran locally um and then let's go back and check your um yeah top start ideas about Highest Potential again it got stuck so the thing with this one is interesting is because a research has been very straightforward for me and it worked uh and like I was uh mentioning earlier that since people got access to this application um it's i' I've seen a lot of these issues where it it hits a wall um and this should have been a very easy um easy thing that should have completed um but it wasn't able to so and again like probably the time of the day is not the best I think a lot of people are probably on it and asking stuff to do so you may be running into more of this issues uh I may try to run this again later like late late in the night um whereas the traffic a little bit lower um and and then the other one is that we try to ask to create a airplane game like Peter fly. peter.com in 3js deploy in public and and you we reach the uh maximum daily usage limit um again this is in a beta stage there's a I believe there's a 10 request or 10 sessions um limit in the day um the cool thing is that even though it says this I can actually go into um another session and run it it's I believe it's the sessions that it matters so I'll I'll use the one that is like broken which is like this one I think right this one's this one's still working so this one's broken so I I'll use this one to say I don't know if this is a loophole that I found but uh when you reach a maximum limit just sound a different session and it will you can't tell it to do something else that's awesome yeah so now see it's like I'll help you create an playing game so it's just like a new session basically but the only only difference is that it's got like all this other stuff in the context so hopefully that doesn't interfere with what I just asked right oh might Victor from hugging face uh actually did something similar but he he didn't specify fly. peter.com but he just say create a you know flying airplane uh game where I can control the airplane and whatnot and it just kind of it looked like he did it in one shot um and I know people are asking like was this one shot or was there like follow-ups but um I'm sure there was a followup it it it doesn't actually like produce everything like in one go sometimes and you may have to kind of tweak some of the uh the features uh especially like um Aesthetics I noticed so you may just like throw like a very simple Aesthetics and you may have to say oh can you make this a little bit more uh pretty or Mak it more I don't know more objects in the scene uh cuz if he just ask you to like create like flying game it may just create like a sky and a and like a plane field and you you may have to give like Specific Instructions on add a building add a tree right at lakes or something something to make you more interesting okay so yeah we might we might even show a clip of of that one shot prompt so just showing what that could look like so men just me a message literally this is just right after the Pod was recorded saying our uh flight game had been created so we basically one prompted a flight game it looks like a more basic version of Peter levels game but it's pretty cool like here you can see the plane flying and I believe you can uh shoot well maybe you can shoot but that's the idea of the game and you shoot down these balloons um which is which is pretty cool um and you can play it uh it's deployed uh you can play it on your web browser I think the next step for me would be how do you I mean just make it look a little more visually cool um and also add multiplayer I think one of the reasons why Peter levels uh game I mean has gotten there's a few reasons why Peter levels has done 67,000 of Revenue in the last 30 days part of it is on his his audience you know he he has a big audience so he can distribute it but the other part is it it is fun I know I tweeted about his game and a lot of people were like it's not it's such a stupid game and it's like I don't know I was playing it for 30 minutes and I was enjoying it like I could have I could have watched the White Lotus but I was watching I was playing that enjoyed it so um Manis did it it took one one little prompt and we got a game working uh so that's really cool and it was deployed so we we've gone over the docy sign we've we've gone over the game uh we've got the SEO um and we've got the research assistant we've done this all in like an hour which is kind of crazy yeah we haven't been able to successfully put deploy you know we we Bas deployed the app basically but it it got us almost there like we just have to review the code deploy it or know run it locally make some edits and then finally deploy it but um overall my take on this Min honestly is that it's yeah it is the closest thing I've seen to AGI yet and it seems it seems like it's close it's not there yet like I need it to I need it to deploy I need it to deploy but the fact that it feels like an operator mixed with like a you know repet mixed with a chat gbt like I think that having having this is is super super super helpful for people who want to like automate build their businesses which you know and that's why I had you on the Pod so Min I want to thank you for for coming on the Pod and I want to ask you you know where could people find you we'll include those links in the show notes um yeah hey thanks for having me and this was uh fun and people can find me on x.com minoy U that's currently my main um page cool all right we'll include that Min thanks for I mean you had the beta access I didn't so thank you for for for hooking it up for everyone I think a lot of people are appreciative of that and uh let's go build some businesses and I got a I got a extra key for you so that you can have access to if you want oh my God yes please do and I'll play around with it if people want more Manis content please do let me know um and uh I'll see you next time Min all right also Min I know this is your first podcast that you've ever done so thank you for sharing it with us hey thanks for thanks for inviting me uh I've always meaning to do one um just didn't get to that step yet uh but maybe this will be uh sort of uh my Kickstart into the podcast World absolutely all right catch you later all right man [Music] baby",
